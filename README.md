# CPP
> This repository contains various "CPP Modules" projects that are part of the École 42 curriculum.

This project contains 9 modules on the fundamentals of C++. The goal of these modules is to introduce students to **Object-Oriented Programming**, which many languages use.
We learn C++ because it’s derived from C, the language in which we learned the core concepts of programming and the one we used in all previous projects at 42.
In fact, because this is a complex language with many new things to learn, and to keep things simple, we must code and comply with the C++98 standard.
We are going to discover new concepts **step-by-step** as the exercises progressively increase in complexity ([wiki](https://github.com/MofMiq/CPP-Modules/wiki/Object-Oriented-Programming-Intro))

## Rules
* In addition to being required to use the **98 standard** in all exercises, we can’t use any other external libraries. It means C++11 (and derived forms) and Boost libraries are forbidden
The following functions are forbidden too: *printf(), *alloc() and free().
* Using namespace <ns_name> and friend keywords are forbidden.
* We are allowed to use the STL in the Module 08 and 09 only. That means: no Containers (vector/list/map/and so forth) and no Algorithms (anything that requires to include the <algorithm> header) until then.
* From Module 02 to Module 09, your classes must be designed in the **Orthodox Canonical Form**, except when explicitely stated otherwise.

### 0️⃣ Module 00 ([wiki](https://github.com/MofMiq/CPP-Modules/wiki/module-00)) 
> The grade in this module is 100/100 ✅

This first module of C++ is designed to help you understand the specifities of the language when compared to C.
Some new concepts we are going to learn in this modelue are:
* Namespaces
* Classes
* Member attributes & functions
* Stdio streams
* This pointer
* Initialization lists
* Accessor & getters
* Static and const
* Some other basic stuff

*  Algorithms

### 9️⃣ Module 09
> The grade in this module is 100/100 ✅

This module is designed to apply, in a more complex way through a series of exercises, not only what was learned in module 08 but also everything from the other modules. Ultimately, it serves as a compendium.
